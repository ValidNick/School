Hi, I'm Nicholas.
I'm interested in games, cool designs such as 3d modeling or coding, sports, specifically Soccer and Basketball, as well as books! 
I'm currently learning coding, or web development more specifically.
I'm looking to collaborate on anything fun and that is impactful to society.
I can be reached at my email @astronick2004@gmail.com!
